## Set Cover

### How to use it:

Pretty straightforward process:

1. Run script
2. Select all covers you want to apply<br>

3. Select if you want to overwrite or not.<br>

#### Overwrite: YES

~~~~
This will search for an image named 001.ext and will replace it with the new cover.
The cover will end up named 001.ext. The already existing file will be named OldCover_001.ext.bk
~~~~

#### Overwrite: NO
~~~~
This will create a file named 0000.ext. 
If there is already an image named that, it will be renamed to OldCover_0000.ext.bk 
~~~~

#### How I personally use this tool:

~~~~
The first thing I do is locate the cover images I am going to use. And name them after the volume they are from
After that I click the button to select the cover images I am going to use.
 
For this example I have 6 files. First 3 are from volume 1 and the rest belong to volume 2
After the first cover shows up. I select if I want to overwrite or not.
Then I select the file that I want to modify to add the cover image.

It will automatically add it to the queue.

I only want to have a cover in the first chapter of each volume and since all my files have covers already i'm going
to delete them.

To delete cover:
I click "Delete covers" and select the files which I want to remove the images from.
They will be added to the queue and will be marked with a recycle bin image that says DELETE.
I personally recommend to have a folder with all the different covers I want to apply to a series and select all of them when asked to open cover files<br>

## Set Volume

### How to use it

1. Run script
2. Change the tool. Select Volume setter in the dropdown at the bottom of the window
3. Click the button to select the files you want to apply the change to
4. Introduce the number of the volume you want to check

#### How I personally use this tool:

~~~~
If I want to have vol.1 in 5 names I follow the instructions.
After that I want to rename multiple files to have vol.2 in its name.
I can just click the select files button and change the number inside of the entry box~~~~~
