## Set Cover

The only available feature since rewrite.

Pretty straightforward process:

1. Run script
2. Select all covers you want to apply<br>
I personally recommend to have a folder with all the different covers i want to apply to a series and select all of them when asked to open cover files<br>
3. Select if you want to overwrite or not.<br>
~~~~
Overwrite: YES
    This will search for an image named 001.ext and will replace it with the new cover.
    The cover will end up named 001.ext. The already existing file will be named OldCover_001.ext.bk
~~~~
~~~~
Overwrite: NO
This will create a file named 0000.ext. 
If there is already an image named that, it will be renamed to OldCover_0000.ext.bk
