## Requirements

Min required version: Python 3.9

## Docker

This suite of applications can be run using Docker!
In the repo's root you can find a docker-compose.yml to use or derive
your docker run command from. Truly essential is to expose
port `3000` and map the volumes for `/manga` and `/covers`. If you want persistent
environment settings for the Desktop Environment also map `/config`.

The stable releases are built from the master branch of this repo,
nightlies are built from the develop branch.
