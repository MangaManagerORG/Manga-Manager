# Welcome to the Manga Manager rework

The current version in this branch is pretty much a brand new MangaManager. The old code was very limited due to how limited its original purpose was.

With a lot of effort and support from the community, the rework was born.

Please note that you are accessing the Beta Version of MangaManger which is in the process of being developed with all it's features before its official release. The sole purpose of this BETA Version is to conduct testing and obtain feedback.
All releases are tested but if you happen to find an error or a bug please report them with the label "Rework Issue".

MangaManager provides a convenient solution for remote access to the software through a web browser.

A docker container with a remote desktop is available. It's important to expose port 3000 and mount the volumes for `/manga` and `/covers`. For detailed instructions, refer to the [docker-compose.yml template at the wiki](https://github.com/ThePromidius/Manga-Manager/wiki/Docker#docker-composeyml).

The stable releases are built from the master branch, while nightly builds are generated from the develop branch.
